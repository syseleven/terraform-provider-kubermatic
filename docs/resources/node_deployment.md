# node_deployment Resource

Node deployment resource in the provider defines the corresponding deployment of nodes.

## Example usage

```hcl
resource "metakube_cluster" "example_cluster" {
  # [...]
}

resource "metakube_node_deployment" "example_node" {
  cluster_id = metakube_cluster.example_cluster.id
  spec {
    replicas = 1
    template {
      cloud {
        aws {
          instance_type     = "t3.small"
          disk_size         = 25
          volume_type       = "standard"
          subnet_id         = "subnet-04f2f551bbc697db3"
          availability_zone = "eu-central-1c"
          assign_public_ip  = true
        }
      }
      operating_system {
        ubuntu {
          dist_upgrade_on_boot = true
        }
      }
	  versions {
	    kubelet = "1.21.3"
	  }
    }
  }
}
```

* `operating_system` - (Required) Operating system settings.
* `versions` - (Optional) K8s components versions.
* `labels` - (Optional) Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. It will be applied to Nodes allowing users run their apps on specific Node using labelSelector.

### `cloud`

One of the following must be selected.

#### Arguments

* `openstack` - (Optional) Openstack node deployment specification.
* `aws` - (Optional) AWS node deployment specification.

### `operating_system`

One of the following must be selected.

#### Arguments

* `ubuntu` - (Exactly one choice, this or another required) Ubuntu operating system and its settings.

* `tags` - (Optional) Additional instance tags.
* `use_floating_ip` - (Optional) Indicate use of floating ip in case of floating_ip_pool presense. Defaults to true.
* `instance_ready_check_period` - (Optional) Specify custom value for how often to check if instance is ready before timing out.
